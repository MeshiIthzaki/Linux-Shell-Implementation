# Shell Implementation

A C-based shell implementation that provides a basic command-line interface with support for background process execution and command history management. The shell allows users to run commands, view command history, and execute commands either in the foreground or background.

## Features

- **Execute Standard Shell Commands:** Run commands directly from the shell.

- **Background Execution:** Run processes in the background by appending & to commands.

- **Command History:** Maintain a history of executed commands, viewable with the history command.
